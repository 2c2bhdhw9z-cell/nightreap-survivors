# Nightreap Survivors — build scratchpad

Plan of record: `/home/user/plan.md` (approved). This file tracks progress, decisions, and blockers.

## Current phase: 0 — Foundation + renderer go/no-go

### Done
- `app_init` → `/home/user/nightreap-survivors`
- `design.md` written: locked palette (core ramp + meaning-bound accents), co-op player colours with
  pip redundancy, `NightreapGlyph` 6×8 / 10×12 bitmap font spec, 8px grid, 9-slice weights, motion
  rules, screen inventory, non-negotiables
- Deps installed in one command before Metro: `expo-gl@16.0.10`, `expo-asset@12.0.13`,
  `expo-font@14.0.12`, `expo-file-system@19.0.23`, `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage@2.2.0`
- `app.json`: name `Nightreap Survivors`, slug `nightreap-survivors`, bundle id
  `com.nightreap_k7q2.runable` (both platforms), splash/adaptive-icon bg → `#141320`,
  iOS `CADisableMinimumFrameDuration: true` for 120Hz. `expo.extra` and `expo.scheme` untouched.

### In progress
- `constants/theme.ts` recolour to design tokens (dark-only: light == dark)
- `game/core/` — `fx.ts` fixed-point + trig LUTs, fixed-timestep loop, named seeded RNG streams,
  entity pools, spatial hash
- `game/render/` — GL bootstrap, shader, sprite batcher, camera, atlas loader
- Gate A benchmark harness

### Next
- `game/net/` scaffolding (input struct, binary codec, tick buffer, state hash, correction sweep)
- Replay harness `scripts/replay-test.ts`
- Atomic save writes + backup slot; remote-config scaffolding; `devgate.ts` + run-taint plumbing
- HUD + one menu mock images → user approval before any screen code
- Gate A: 5,000 textured quads @ 60fps with overlay

### Decisions made this phase
- Bundle short id: `k7q2`
- Game is dark-only; `Colors.light` and `Colors.dark` hold identical values rather than fighting
  `userInterfaceStyle: "automatic"`
- Engine lives at `packages/mobile/game/` with zero React Native imports (headless CI + future
  web/desktop shell swap)

### Blockers / flags for the user
- No `gh` CLI in the sandbox — GitHub linking is platform-side. Needs confirming from the Runable UI
  so Phase 0 can end with a real backup push.

## Decisions added 2026-08-11
- Injected tweak menus (iOSGods-style) assumed present at launch; see plan.md §5b addendum.
  - Ladder submissions require mandatory server-side replay revalidation (was sampled).
  - Co-op guests run plausibility checks on host events; modded host = session non-counting.
- Dev menu visual direction: first mock generated at mocks/dev-menu_1786425984059.png,
  awaiting user yes/no before any dev-menu screen code (mock-first HARD GATE).
  - Known mock artifact: two steppers rendered "[·]" instead of "[+]" — text render glitch, not design.
- Dev menu structure settled: 8 horizontally-scrolling tabs (SIM/SPAWN/RUN/BUILD/MOD/RNDR/DEV/INPT),
  each its own scroll view. Pinned: top bar, status strip, search, tab bar, bottom taint warning.
  Global search across all toggles + user-configurable FAVORITES row.
  Tabbed mock: mocks/dev-menu-tabbed_1786426225031.png (BUILD tab, density proven).

## Verified 2026-08-11 (first real verification pass)
- `bun run typecheck` PASS (3/3 packages). WebGLRenderingContext DOM types resolve via
  expo/tsconfig.base — structural-GL-interface fallback NOT needed. Assumption closed.
- `bun run lint` PASS (konsistent 17 files + oxlint 66 files, 0 warnings 0 errors).
- `bun run build` PASS.
- Metro running on port 4300. `/dev/bench` route mounts.
- expo-gl web support CONFIRMED (GLView -> WebGL canvas). Assumption closed.
- Headless Chrome default = NO WebGL at all. Forced SwiftShader via
  --use-gl=angle --use-angle=swiftshader --enable-unsafe-swiftshader to run the harness.
- HARNESS CORRECTNESS VERIFIED: 5172 quads -> 5 draw calls / 5 layers, procedural debug atlas
  uploads and samples correctly, batcher packs pos/uv/colour correctly, overlay reports
  p50/p95/p99 + dropped ticks + quad/draw/layer counts.
- Software-GL baseline (MEANINGLESS for the gate, recorded only as a floor):
  5172 quads @ 126.0ms p50 / 246.0ms p95 / 291.0ms p99, 7.9fps, 684 dropped ticks.
- GATE A STILL UNDECIDED. Requires native hardware (REVVL + iPhone). Blocker for Phase 0 close.

## Fixed 2026-08-11 — preview "open does nothing"
Root cause was two separate bugs, both reproduced and fixed:
1. `/` still rendered the stock template "Welcome" + failing API ping, with NO route into the
   bench. Opening the preview looked like a no-op. -> rewrote app/(tabs)/index.tsx as a dev
   launcher with a GATE A BENCH button + warm-test instructions. Navigation verified by click.
2. `/dev/bench` HARD CRASHED to the error boundary ("Something went wrong / Browser does not
   support WebGL") on any browser without WebGL, because GLView throws during render.
   -> added webglAvailable() guard + explanatory fallback screen. Verified both paths:
      no-WebGL browser shows the fallback, SwiftShader browser still renders 5172 quads / 5 draws.
3. Bench overlay was illegible over the quad storm (no background). -> panel is now opaque ink
   with a 1px stoneLit bottom border. Verified legible.
typecheck + lint pass after each change.

## GitHub — live 2026-08-11
- Private repo: github.com/2c2bhdhw9z-cell/nightreap-survivors (branch `main`, 111 files).
- Push verified by fetch. `.env` confirmed NOT on remote (Turso token / S3 keys / auth secret safe).
- Token stored in gitignored credential store, NOT in .git/config or the remote URL.
- ACTION FOR USER: rotate the PAT — it was pasted in plain chat.
- .gitignore hardened: `*.env` + `.git-credentials*` (a bare `.env` rule would not have caught
  an `ask_secrets` file written as `.git-credentials.env`).
- CONFIRMED BUG in plan: `.gitignore` line 73 excludes `scripts/`, so the planned
  `scripts/replay-test.ts` would be silently untracked. Replay harness moves to
  `packages/mobile/game/replay/` instead. Do not put version-controlled code in `scripts/`.

## Native testing loop — CONFIRMED 2026-08-11
- Metro serves a valid iOS manifest over the public HTTPS proxy (runtimeVersion exposdk:54.0.0).
- iOS Hermes bundle builds clean: HTTP 200, 7.3 MB, no transform errors.
- `ExpoGL` + `ExponentGLObjectManager` present in the iOS bundle, and expo-gl ships inside the
  Expo Go binary for SDK 54 -> **Gate A can be measured in Expo Go. No custom dev build needed.**
  This closes the plan's open "does expo-gl work under Expo Go" assumption for iOS.
- Expo Go URL (manual entry): exp://nightre-oqwfyiy-preview-4300.runable.site
- Android/REVVL: same URL in Expo Go, or just Chrome for a browser-WebGL number.
- iPhone Safari preview datapoint from user (real hardware, browser WebGL):
  8172 quads @ 21.0ms p50 / 47.6fps / 0 dropped ticks / 5 draws / 5 layers.
  Encouraging: 63% above the 5,000 gate, in a browser, with zero dropped ticks.
- STILL OPEN: the 5,000-quad warm number on the REVVL. That is the WebGL-vs-Skia decision.
  User is at work; deferred.

## Bench instrument fixes — 2026-08-11 (two bugs from the native iPhone screenshot)

### Bug 1 — FIXED: frame timing used `Date.now()`
`Date.now()` has 1ms integer resolution, which cannot measure a 16.67ms budget. That is why the
first native readout showed `17.0ms p50 / 17.0 p95 / 17.0 p99 / 17.0 worst` — four identical
numbers are not four measurements, they are one quantised number printed four times. All sub-ms
jitter was invisible and p50 vs p99 was meaningless.
Fix: `nowMs()` helper prefers `performance.now()` (Hermes has it on RN 0.81 / SDK 54) and falls
back to `Date.now()`. Used for both `timer.push()` and `loop.advance()`. `Date.now()` is kept only
for the warm clock, where it measures minutes and 1ms resolution is fine.
Verified in SwiftShader: percentiles now spread (147.5 / 477.8 / 542.8 / 717.7ms) instead of flat.
**Every Gate A number recorded before this fix is void, including the 58.8fps iPhone result.**

### Bug 2 — sprites froze ~30-40s in, panel kept updating. NOT root-caused, now diagnosable.
Ruled out: the sim itself. `game/bench/storm-soak.ts` (new, headless, no GL, no React) ran
200,000 ticks = ~55 min of sim time at 5,000 quads: no freeze, no NaN, nothing escaped the field,
0 entities stuck. `QuadStorm.tick()` is clean.
That leaves three suspects, which the old panel could not tell apart, because the readout is a
React Native view composited *on top of* the GL surface — a climbing counter proved only that
JavaScript was alive, not that anything reached the display.
Instrumentation added so the next run identifies it without guessing:
- `sim Xs / real Ys` row. Sim clock is derived from the tick counter, real from the wall. They must
  stay within ~1s. This survives a screenshot, which a moving sprite does not.
- `ticks/frame` and `stale Nms` (ms since the tick counter last changed) + a `SIM STALLED` banner.
- Two heartbeat bars drawn *inside GL* at the bottom of the screen (`QuadStorm.drawHeartbeat`):
  gold advances per rendered frame, cyan per sim tick.
Reading the result:
- gold frozen + panel still counting frames -> GL stopped presenting (bug is below us in expo-gl).
- cyan frozen + gold moving -> the fixed loop stopped ticking.
- both moving + sprites still -> bug is in the storm after all.
- Also: a throw inside the frame callback used to be invisible, because rAF is rescheduled on the
  first line — the loop kept running while nothing rendered. Now caught, counted, and displayed.
Note: Bug 1's clock also fed `loop.advance()`, so a clock-resolution stall is possible and may
already be fixed by the same change.

### NEXT RUN IS THE GATE A VERDICT
iPhone: exp://nightre-oqwfyiy-preview-4300.runable.site pasted into the **Safari address bar**
(offers "Open in Expo Go"). REVVL: same URL in Expo Go, or plain Chrome for a browser number.
5000 preset, HUD on, ~15 min warm, then screenshot. REVVL is the device that decides WebGL vs Skia.
